<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dual-Fuel Marine Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Four-Stroke Dual-Fuel Engines</li><li>Two-Stroke Dual-Fuel Engines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dual-fuel marine engines are classified into two main types: four-stroke dual-fuel engines and two-stroke dual-fuel engines. Four-stroke dual-fuel engines operate on a four-stroke combustion cycle, offering improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions. On the other hand, two-stroke dual-fuel engines operate on a two-stroke cycle, providing higher power output but sometimes at the cost of higher emissions. Both types of engines are used in the marine industry to provide propulsion for ships while offering the flexibility to use different fuel types.</p></p>
