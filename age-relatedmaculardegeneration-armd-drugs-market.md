<p><strong>The Age-relatedMacularDegeneration (ARMD) Drugs Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exudative ARMD</li><li>Atrophy ARMD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Age-related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) drugs are used to treat two main types of the disease: Exudative ARMD and Atrophy ARMD. Exudative ARMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow underneath the macula and leak fluid, causing vision problems. Drugs for this type of ARMD aim to reduce the growth of these blood vessels. Atrophy ARMD, on the other hand, is characterized by the gradual breakdown of cells in the macula, leading to a loss of central vision. Drugs for this type of ARMD focus on slowing down the progression of cell degeneration.</p></p>
