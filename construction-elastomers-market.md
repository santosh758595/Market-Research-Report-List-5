<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Elastomers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermoset Plastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Construction elastomers market can be broadly divided into two main types: thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) and thermoset plastics. TPEs are flexible and can be molded and reshaped multiple times, making them ideal for applications such as sealants and gaskets in construction. On the other hand, thermoset plastics are rigid and once they are molded into a specific shape, they cannot be reshaped. These are commonly used in construction for applications such as insulation and roofing materials. Both types play a crucial role in the construction industry due to their unique properties and versatility.</p></p>
