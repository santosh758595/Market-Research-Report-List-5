<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Hydraulic Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston</li><li>Positive-Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric hydraulic pumps are categorized into two main types - piston pumps and positive-displacement pumps. Piston pumps operate by using reciprocating pistons to generate hydraulic fluid flow, providing high pressure levels and precise control. On the other hand, positive-displacement pumps create flow by trapping a specific amount of fluid and forcing it into the system, ensuring a constant flow rate regardless of pressure changes. Both types of pumps are commonly used in various industrial applications that require reliable and efficient hydraulic systems.</p></p>
