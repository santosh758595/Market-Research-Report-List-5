<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biocoal (Synthetic Coal) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biocoal, also known as synthetic coal, is produced through two main processes: torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to create a coal-like material with higher energy content and improved storage and handling characteristics. On the other hand, steam explosion involves treating biomass with high-pressure steam followed by a rapid decompression, resulting in a more easily digestible material for use as fuel. Both torrefaction and steam explosion processes are key players in the growing biocoal market.</p></p>
