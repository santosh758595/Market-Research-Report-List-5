<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Anesthesia Video Laryngoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li><li>Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disposable Anesthesia Video Laryngoscopes come in two main types: Channelled and Un-Channelled. Channelled Video Laryngoscopes have a built-in channel that guides the endotracheal tube into the airway, making intubation easier and more efficient. On the other hand, Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes do not have this channel, requiring the operator to manually navigate the endotracheal tube into the airway. Both types offer the convenience and hygiene benefits of disposability, reducing the risk of cross-contamination and infections during anesthesia procedures.</p></p>
