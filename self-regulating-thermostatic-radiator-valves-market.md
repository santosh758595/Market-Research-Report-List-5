<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-regulating Thermostatic Radiator Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-operate Thermostatic Radiator Valves</li><li>Electronic Thermostatic Radiator Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-regulating Thermostatic Radiator Valves are of two types: Self-operate and Electronic. Self-operate valves use a wax-filled sensor to automatically adjust the flow of hot water through the radiator, based on the room's temperature. Electronic valves, on the other hand, use a digital sensor and allow for more precise control of the room's temperature by connecting to a central heating system. Both types of valves help to regulate the heating in a room, providing better comfort and energy efficiency.</p></p>
