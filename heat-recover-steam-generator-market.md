<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Recover Steam Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Horizontal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) can be classified based on their orientation into two main types – vertical and horizontal markets. Vertical HRSGs are commonly used in applications where space availability is limited, as they occupy a smaller footprint. On the other hand, horizontal HRSGs are suitable for larger installations where a compact design is not a priority. Both types offer efficient heat recovery from exhaust gases to generate steam for various industrial processes, but their orientation determines their suitability for different market demands.</p></p>
