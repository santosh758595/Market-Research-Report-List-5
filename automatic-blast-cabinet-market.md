<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Blast Cabinet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Blast Cabinet</li><li>Suction Blast Cabinet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic blast cabinets are used for abrasive blasting of surfaces in various industries. There are two main types of automatic blast cabinets: pressure blast cabinets and suction blast cabinets. </p><p>Pressure blast cabinets use compressed air to propel the abrasive material onto the surface being cleaned or prepared. This type of cabinet is typically used for heavy-duty applications and can achieve a higher level of surface cleanliness.</p><p>Suction blast cabinets, on the other hand, use a vacuum system to create suction that pulls the abrasive material onto the surface. This type of cabinet is more commonly used for lighter applications and is generally more cost-effective than pressure blast cabinets.</p></p>
