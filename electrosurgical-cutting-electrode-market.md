<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgical Cutting Electrode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar Electrosurgery</li><li>Monopolar Electrosurgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrosurgical cutting electrodes are used in two main types of electrosurgery: bipolar and monopolar. Bipolar electrosurgery uses two electrodes to deliver electrical current directly to the surgical site, minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. Monopolar electrosurgery uses one active electrode and a grounding pad on the patient's body to complete the circuit. Both types of electrosurgical cutting electrodes are essential tools for surgeons in various specialties to achieve precise and efficient cutting during procedures.</p></p>
