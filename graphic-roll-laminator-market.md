<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphic Roll Laminator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Graphic Roll Laminator</li><li>Cold Graphic Roll Laminator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat Graphic Roll Laminators use heat to melt the adhesive on the laminating film, which helps to seal and protect documents or graphics. These laminators are commonly used for items that are sensitive to high pressure or require a more permanent seal. On the other hand, Cold Graphic Roll Laminators do not use heat during the laminating process, making them ideal for heat-sensitive materials like photos or delicate documents. Cold laminators are often preferred for items that may warp or distort under heat.</p></p>
