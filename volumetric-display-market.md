<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volumetric Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Swept-Volume Display</li><li>Solid-Volume Display</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Volumetric displays are divided into two main types: Swept-Volume Displays and Solid-Volume Displays. Swept-Volume Displays create 3D images by sweeping a 2D display surface through a volume of space, creating the illusion of a 3D image. On the other hand, Solid-Volume Displays directly create a physical representation of an object within a volume of space, utilizing technologies such as holograms or light field displays. Both types of volumetric displays offer unique capabilities and applications within industries such as entertainment, healthcare, and education.</p></p>
