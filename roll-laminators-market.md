<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roll Laminators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heated Roll Laminater</li><li>Cold Roll Laminater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Roll laminators are divided into two main types: heated roll laminators and cold roll laminators. Heated roll laminators use heat to melt the adhesive on the lamination film, which then bonds to the material being laminated. This type of laminator is ideal for high-quality, professional results. On the other hand, cold roll laminators do not require heat and are better suited for heat-sensitive materials. They use pressure to apply the adhesive, making them a more versatile option for a variety of materials.</p></p>
