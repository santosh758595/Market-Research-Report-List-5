<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial pressure monitoring market can be classified into two types - invasive and non-invasive. Invasive monitoring involves inserting a device directly into the brain to measure pressure, providing more accurate readings but posing a higher risk of complications. Non-invasive monitoring, on the other hand, uses external devices like helmets or sensors placed on the skin to estimate intracranial pressure without the need for invasive procedures. Each type of monitoring has its own advantages and limitations, catering to different patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
