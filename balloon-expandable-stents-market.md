<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon-expandable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stents</li><li>Drug-eluting Stents</li><li>Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Balloon-expandable stents are medical devices used to treat narrowed or blocked arteries. The three main types of balloon-expandable stents are bare-metal stents, drug-eluting stents, and bioabsorbable stents. Bare-metal stents are uncoated metal mesh tubes that help prop open arteries. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication to prevent restenosis, the re-narrowing of the artery. Bioabsorbable stents are designed to slowly dissolve in the body over time. Each type of stent offers unique benefits and is used in different clinical situations.</p></p>
